### ***Multi - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy!*** <a name="overview"></a>
*An all in one DNS blocklist in **various versions (light, normal, pro, pro++ and ultimate)**. It can be used as a stand alone blocklist. For every region. Blocks ads, affiliate, tracking, metrics, telemetry, fake, phishing, malware, scam, coins and other "crap". Based on [various blocklists](usedsources.md).*

### ***Recommendation*** <a name="recommendation"></a>

*As a network-wide DNS blocker, I recommend using [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com), [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/), [TechnitiumDNS](https://technitium.com/dns/), [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) (advanced users) or [eBlocker](https://eblocker.org/).*
        
*DNS blocker offer a good protection of privacy by blocking tracking, metrics and telemetry. They can be used to block the vast majority of ads, malware, scam, fake and co, but not everything can be blocked at the DNS level!         
Therefore, I* ***additionally*** *recommend the use of a browser content blocker such as [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) or [uBlock](https://ublockorigin.com) with the appropriate block lists (EasyList, AdGuard, uBlock, ...).*
                     
*Check out @yokoffing's [Recommended Filters for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists) for content blocker filter lists.*

### ***About*** <a name="about"></a>

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=hagezi/dns-blocklists" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>"If the plan doesn‘t work, change the plan but never the goal."<br>There's no place like 127.0.0.1!</b></i></p>

*The blocklists are based on [various sources](usedsources.md) and my own [blacklists](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-data-collection/tree/main/data). They were designed to avoid [false positive domains](whitelist.txt) as much as possible without losing effectiveness and efficiency. [Dead hosts](deadlist.txt) are regularly removed from the lists to keep them as small as possible. Made with :heartbeat: for a safer and cleaner internet.*         
*All lists were tested against 6000 websites from the Cisco Umbrella Top 1 million list. It was checked whether the pages load, the page content is displayed correctly, navigation links work, images load, videos start and much more.*                 
*They are updated and maintained daily.*
                        
*No, it's not just blocklists cobbled together from multiple sources. They have been optimized and extended to efficiently "clean the Internet" in all areas.                   
Test them and give [feedback](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/discussions)!*
                
*Please [report false positive](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/issues) domains.*

#### Referral Domains <a name="referral"></a>

*Affiliate and tracking links (referral domains) that appear frequently on offer web pages, in emails or in search results are allowed in my lists. These are mostly called only after manual clicking on a link and are not used to display advertising.
If these are blocked, the first hit links from search results, for example, no longer work.* 
          
*[Referral domains](whitelist-referral.txt) have been removed from all lists except from the ultimate list, only some of them were removed but not all!*
                  
*There are users who want to block referral domains anyway, so for each list I show the domains that were whitelisted because of referral. You can see them in the list of [used sources](usedsources.md) behind the link "whitelisted referral domains" per list.
This list can then be used as a blocklist to "undo" the whitelisting of referral domains.*
          
*Allowing referral domains in my lists is equivalent to the [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=jvpyfdfc) feature "Privacy > Allow Affiliate & Tracking Links".*
          
#### Support Me <a name="support"></a>

*I do not want any money donations. If you don't know what to do with your money, invest it in aid or similar projects, do something good with it. There is enough misery in the world.*             
*Accepting money donations would also be absolutely unfair to the maintainers of the sources used, that's not my way. Without the existing lists. these lists would be simply nothing.*
                                    
*If you like the project and you can benefit from it, leave a :star: (top right) and become a [stargazer](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/stargazers)!* 
                                
*Give feedback, show me your ideas, report false positve domains and help to keep the internet safe and clean.*               
*Help and cooperation of any kind is welcome!*
         
***Thanks for your support!***
